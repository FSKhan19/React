I am using VS Code extension called Quokka.js for this project. Due to free version it doesn't allowing me import functionality. So, I will repeat file reading code in each section sorry for that.

Quokka.js is a developer productivity tool for rapid JavaScript / TypeScript prototyping. Runtime values are updated and displayed in your IDE next to your code, as you type.

You can get it from => https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode
